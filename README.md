## About the Nonprofit Management Institute

The Nonprofit Management Institute (NPMI) is a research-based capacity-building program for nonprofit organizations.

NPMI is a six-session series that covers the core fundamentals of nonprofit management. It is designed for new and emerging nonprofit leaders who seek to strengthen their leadership skills while building organizational capacity to advance mission-driven work.

Overall, the Institute serves as a professional development and training opportunity for nonprofit professionals, equipping them to maximize their impact within their organizations and communities.

## Project Mission
